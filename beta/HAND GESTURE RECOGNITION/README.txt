Our project deals with developing an efficient and accurate hand gesture to voice
conversion system that can recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time and convert
them into corresponding voice commands or messages. The purpose of developing a
hand gesture to voice conversion system is to enhance communication for individuals
with physical disabilities.The need for such a system arises from the limitations faced
by individuals who have difficulty speaking and to facilitate the elderly people. Here a
deep learning model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a large
dataset of labeled hand gestures. The trained deep learning model will be used to classify
the input hand gestures in real-time.The mapped voice commands or messages will be
generated using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. A hybrid approach that combines deep
learning techniques with sensor-based systems offers a promising solution for accurate and
robust hand gesture recognition ensuring real-time performance which is crucial for an
effective user experience
