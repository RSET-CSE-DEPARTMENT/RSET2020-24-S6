## **Automated Overtaking Detection System For Bridges**

This project we have developed an automatic overtaking detection system that helps to
identify people who overtake vehicles in bridges, accurately recording the violators’ details
to the database. The officials upload a camera footage, the program then uses machine
learning and object detection to identify the violators, take the image, understand and
extract the part of the image that shows the number plate of cars. We then use optical
character recognition (OCR) to extract the characters from the region of interest and add
it to the database.
Due to lack of dataset we have chosen an highway input instead of bridges.

This project is a combined effort done by M S Rahul, Mathew Shaji, Harikrishnan R and Jai Mathew James of class CSBeta Batch 2024, Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kakkanad.

## Expected System Requirements

The system of user is expected to have the following features:
• Windows should be version 10 or above
• Requirement of Internet connection for login and addition to database.
• A storage space of approximate 3 GB for the app.
• A minimum Ram size of 12GB is required in the device.
• Graphics Card with GPU: NVIDIA Ge Force GTX
