# SpeakingToy

The NLP speaking toy leverages Dialogflow, a powerful cloud-based NLP platform, to understand and interpret user inputs.
Dialogflow employs advanced algorithms for intent recognition and entity extraction, allowing the toy to comprehend the user's commands and queries effectively. By utilizing Dialogflow's pre-built integration with the Angular web framework, the toy gains access to a robust development ecosystem and a user-friendly interface for designing conversational flows.The Angular web framework provides the infrastructure for developing the toy's user interface, business logic, and integration with external APIs.
