# BugSenseAI

BugSenseAI is a mobile application that utilizes a CNN model to identify insect bites from the image taken or uploaded by the user and suggest remedies for instant relief. 

## Problem Statement
The lack of a user-friendly and accurate system for insect bite identification poses a
challenge for individuals who need immediate information and remedies. This can lead
to confusion, delay in appropriate actions, and potentially worsening health conditions.
Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and accessible mobile application that can accurately predict the type of insect bite and provide suitable remedies.

BugSenseAI is a mobile application, making it easily accessible to users anytime, anywhere. Users can conveniently capture and upload images of the insect bite, receive
real-time predictions, and access remedies directly from their mobile devices. This eliminates the need for extensive research or seeking professional advice, providing immediate
assistance at the usersâ€™ fingertips.

## Technologies Used
+ ML Framework: Tensorflow, Keras
+ Image Pre Processing and Model Training: Python
+ App Development: Kotlin

## Insect Bite Identification
The CNN model used is ResNet50, specifically trained to classify different insect bites, such as those from bees, mosquitoes, spiders, ticks, and cases where no identifiable insect is involved ('None'). The bite is accurately predicted through image preprocessing and subsequent analysis by the trained model, identifying the insect responsible for the bite and offering appropriate remedies for immediate relief.



## Conclusion
BugSenseAI , an app that utilizes image recognition technology has the potential to
bring several valuable benefits to users and public health efforts.
By leveraging AI-powered image recognition algorithms, the app can offer improved
accuracy, early detection, and enhanced accessibility for identifying insect bites and
stings and suggest remedies.
These features can empower users to take timely measures for prevention and seek
appropriate medical attention if necessary.
